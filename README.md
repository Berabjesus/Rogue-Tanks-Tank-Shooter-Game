<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="./public/sshot.gif" width="auto" height="auto" />

This tank shooter game is developed using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) Javascript framework. The requirement for this project is stated [here](https://www.notion.so/Shooter-game-203e819041c7486bb36f9e65faecba27). Under the hood, Javascript ES6 is the main programming language used. The inspiration behind this project is to create a browser game that look like a classic retro game by applying fundamental game development guidelines and designs as well as structured and readable code.



### Instructions
You will start this game by having control of a tank to move around and destroy enemy tanks. Read the control instruction carefully below.
- The game starts by loading and asking you to insert your name. After that, click on the Play button and start the game.
- You will be spawned on the bottom right corner of your screen. 
- From there, you can navigate and move forward and backward using `W` and `S` keys. You can rotate the tank body using `A` and `D` keys.
- The [turret](https://bitsofwar.com/3214-thickbox_bosky/legionary-assault-tank-turret-heavy-autocannon.jpg) of the tank is the body part that fire bullets or cannons. You have to rotate it using your mouse button.
- To fire, `point` your cursor on an enemy tank with your mouse and `click` on it or hit the `spacebar` key.
- Enemy tanks are designed to chase you if you get close to them. They are faster in general, but you can boost your speed using the `E` key.
- Your score and health are displayed on the top left and top right part of the screen respectively.
- Your health will regenerate if your hit. 
- When you die, you can restart the game or head back to the menu. Either way, your score, and name will be uploaded to the leaderboard API. 
- On the menu screen, you can navigate to the options screen to turn audio on/off. The credits screen will show information regarding the developer, and the leaderboard screen will fetch scores.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To set this project upon a local environment clone, or download this repo and follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Web browser
- CLI tool
- npm
  `npm install npm@latest -g`
  
Note: Some browsers may have their GPU hardware acceleration turned off. You have to turn this feature or for a smooth gaming experience. For example, use [this](https://www.lifewire.com/hardware-acceleration-in-chrome-4125122) instruction to turn chromes GPU feature on if you experience a lag

### Installation
1. Navigate to the root folder of your local copy and, using any CLI tool, type `npm i`, and press Enter. This will install the dependencies.
2. After that is completed, 
- If you want to repack the file
  - Run `npm run build` to pack the files in the src folder
  - Go to the build folder and open index.html
- Else
  - Run `npm run start` to open it on a live server. NB The port is set to 3003. 

### Testing
- Navigate to the root folder of your local copy and type `npm run test` to run jest.
- You can add more tests in the `./test` directory.
### other information
- I have used underscore score to identify private properties and methods in some classes. As you can see in this [eslint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-underscore-dangle) it's purely a preference. and I have disabled the respective eslint rules off.

- I have commented out `  pixelArt: true, roundPixels: true,` rules but feel free to uncomment them, remove the `/*` and `*/`, before and after them to enable the retro look.
